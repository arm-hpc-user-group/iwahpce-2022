# IWAHPCE-2022 - International workshop on Arm-based HPC: practice and Experience


### Abstract
The objective of this workshop is to provide the opportunity to share the practice and experience about the high performance computing systems using the Arm architecture, and their performance and applications. 

The world’s fastest Japanese supercomputer Fugaku is using Futjisu A64FX arm-based manycore processors, and the Astra at Sandia National Laboratories is the first large-scale Arm-based supercomputer using Marvell’s ThunderX 2. The last few years have seen an explosion of 64-bit Arm based processors targeted towards server and infrastructure workloads – often with a specialization towards a specific domain – such as HPC, cloud and machine learning. Arm’s new Neoverse reference N1 core design has become the foundation for a number of emerging processors such as Amazon’s 64-core Graviton2 and Ampere’s 80-core Altra, with the EPI project incorporating the successor design into SiPearl’s Rhea chip. Recently, the new processor, Grace, integrated with NVIDIA GPU, is announced. GPU-integrated Arm-based system is also an emerging architecture.
Sharing the practice and experiences using these Arm-based processors will contribute to the advance of high performance computing technology for newly designed system using these new emerging Arm-based processors.

In this workshop we invite papers on the practice and experience on the Arm-based high performance computing systems, if available, optimization and performance analysis of high-performance workloads for this new generation of Arm-based processors. We welcome performance optimization studies either through access to real hardware or via simulation/emulation frameworks.

This workshop is the is a proceedings-based workshop that is closely related to the series of workshops organized at ISC, SC and the Arm Research Summit by groups like the [Arm HPC User Group (AHUG)](a-hug.org).
